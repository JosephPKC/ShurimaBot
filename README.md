# ShurimaBot
Bot for discord that specializes in League of Legends.

The idea is to learn about various APIs, Python, unit testing, and so on.
* Create a wrapper library for Riot's League of Legends API (and other APIs if they have them).
* Use the python discord wrapper library to create the discord bot.
* Set up unit testing using unittest or pytest.
* Set up a Django database if needed to store non-changing information to limit API calls.
* Potentially set up a web app to interface and distribute the bot if needed.

Other goals:
* Integrate Path of Exile API and other APIs.
* Add additional basic functionality to the bot, such as music, lookups, and more.
